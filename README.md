Bringing positivity to life and Music are my core passions. I've found programming has parallels to music. In a backwards way, I learned how to use the computer, which I once thought I couldn't do, through using music programs. Computers, their languages, and the internet are the new age tools and they can be used to foster positivity in life. Onward and upward through this journey into Technology to help provide a better future for ourselves, the planet, the Universe and God.
